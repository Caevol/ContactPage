# ContactPage
Simple Contact Page that sends emails


App.js handles server calls, index.js runs email call in app.post('/')<p>
Please change the "to" email before running the server so I am not spammed <p>
gmail has started rejecting my computer's emails as spam, so you may need to change the "from" as well.<p>
